## Ethical Implications <Frances>
In building this web application from an engineer’s perspective, 
we have a few key ethical and professional responsibilities to address. 
First, data privacy: users entrust us with personal details (names, emails) 
and their in-app activity. It’s important to clearly explain what we collect, 
why we collect it, and whether any third parties might access that information. 
Being upfront about data sharing builds trust and helps users feel secure. Secondly, 
professional responsibility means writing clean, maintainable code and keeping documentation 
current. That way, anyone joining the project can quickly understand its structure and contribute 
without confusion or frustration.
<br/>
<br/>
Engineering decisions can be visible through society in both obvious and subtle ways. 
Take social media as an example: it can foster creativity and community, yet studies from Yale 
Medicine note that overstimulating the brain’s reward centers can mirror addiction pathways. 
That dual nature reminds us to think through potential downsides when designing new features. 
<br/>
<br/>
Finally, engineering solutions extend far beyond lines of code; they shape economies, environments, 
and societies in both big and small ways. A well-built feature can streamline everyday tasks, create 
new business opportunities, or connect people across continents, but it can also centralize/overuse 
resources, widen inequalities, or create unintended environmental strain. That means when we design our
app’s functionality, from data storage to recommendation engines, we should be mindful of who benefits, 
who might be left out, and how can we minimize waste.
